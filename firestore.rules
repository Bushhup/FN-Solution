/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model combined with
 * user ownership. It defines two primary roles: 'Admin' and 'User'.
 * The Admin role is assigned to a specific, hardcoded email address, granting
 * broad read and write permissions. Standard users have strict ownership
 * over their own profile and any leads they submit while authenticated.
 * Anonymous users have read-only access to public information and the ability
 * to submit leads.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into several top-level collections:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data.
 * - /services/{serviceId}: A public catalog of company services.
 * - /leads/{leadId}: A collection of all user-submitted inquiries.
 * - /testimonials/{testimonialId}: A public collection of customer reviews.
 * This structure segregates public, private, and managed data for clarity
 * and security.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin status is determined by matching the user's email to a specific
 *   hardcoded value ('frank@gmail.com'). This is a simple and direct approach
 *   for a single-administrator system.
 * - Listing all users is explicitly disallowed for non-admins to protect user privacy.
 * - Public data (services, testimonials) is structurally segregated into its
 *   own collections, making list operations inherently safe.
 * - Leads can be created by anyone, but viewing is restricted. Authenticated
 *   users can only see their own leads, while admins can see all leads.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To create simpler and more performant rules, we denormalize authorization data:
 * - leads.userId: Each lead document submitted by an authenticated user contains
 *   a denormalized 'userId' field. This allows a user to query for their own
 *   leads and for security rules to verify ownership without extra database reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Public and private data are stored in separate top-level collections. For
 * example, /services and /testimonials are fully public for reads, while /users
 * is strictly private on a per-user basis (except for admins). This prevents accidental data
 * leakage from list queries.
